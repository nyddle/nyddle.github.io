In March I luckily converted into a Founders Institute applicant from a crappy banner on a local startup community site. FI is an American startup accelerator franchisee that takes $1000 and 3.5% of your business in exchange for some solid startup advice packed into a four months course (weekly 2h+ lectures and huge home assignments).

The program fully met my expectations: lots of networking, lulz and a decent kick-in-the-ass. I teamed with some great guys and we are ready to drop our next bomb that will shutter the internet. The course was really tough (only 30% of applicants got to the end) but I managed to outsource some home assignmens to my cofounder and happily graduated.


Adeo (FI CEO) turned out as dicky as we expected him to be from his lectures dropping our dream team for not meeting his stupid legal requirements (the details are too boring to get into). Anyway (thanx Dima Rockityanski superhero efforts) we won the battle and luckily graduated.
